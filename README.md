# isitholiday [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cbrunnkvist/isitholiday.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cbrunnkvist/isitholiday)

Is today a holiday, and if so, which one?

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install isitholiday`

Start the default server with: `npm start`

## Documentation
A minimalistic webapp (for a "single serving website" as they are sometimes called) that figures out whether or not today is a registered/public holiday, and delivers a response in large, friendly letters. Useful in the morning when you need to quickly decide should you get dressed and go to work/class or stay at home and wear nothing but a towel.

The calendar information on the backend is either based on static data (a JSON dump) or derived from a public Google Calendar. 

In the latter case, the calendar feed will get converted from iCal format and subsequently persisted locally.

## Examples

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
